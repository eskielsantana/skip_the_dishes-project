# My SkipTheDishes interview challenge project README

 There is a .sql file on the root of this application. This is the script to recreates the mysql database which my challenge application uses
 
 The name of the database must be "skipthedisheschallenge" the same as the file name but if you prefer, you can change the name in the "resources/application.properties"
 
 You can access the webservices using the swagger page "http://localhost:8080/"
 To do any interaction with the order webservices its needed a token generated using the "api/v1/Customer/auth" path after had registered a customer using "api/v1/Customer" 


 Finally, I would like to say thank you for the opportunity you gave to all of us and for the experience of being participated in this fair. I have met many awesome people here.
 I'm pretty sure I will always remember this day.
